        Forestation and tree growth are perhaps the most powerful tool for
        reducing levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth’s
        atmosphere and tackling climate change. Now genetically modified (GM)
        ‘supertrees’ that grow faster and rapidly take up CO2 could be used to
        address the climate crisis.

        The monkey puzzle tree is a remnant of the Jurassic era, more than 145
        million years ago, surviving way past its ancient dinosaur counterparts.
        Reaching heights of about 160 feet, the evergreen tree has a lifespan of
        up to 700 years and stiff scaly branches with rigid spiral leaves.
        Monkey puzzle trees’ presence in the wild is shrinking and after million
        years, their very existence is now endangered.
